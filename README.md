# Grynz - The Universal Compiler

## Overview
Grynz is a modular, universal compiler designed to compile multiple programming languages with a single command-line interface. The goal is to provide a seamless experience for developers by detecting the language of a given source file and compiling it using the appropriate compiler, handling project structures and dependencies where necessary.

## Current Status
Grynz is in its early development stage and currently supports the following languages:
- **C** (via `gcc`)
- **C++** (via `g++`)
- **Rust** (via `rustc`)
- **Go** (via `go build`)
- **Java** (via `javac` and `java` for execution)
- **Zig** (via `zig build-exe` and `zig run` to compile and output instantly)

## Features Implemented
### Compilation System
- Detects file type based on extension and invokes the appropriate compiler.
- Supports specifying an output directory using the `--out` flag (except for Zig, which does not store compiled output without project initialization).
- Handles compilation errors and outputs relevant messages.

### Java Execution System
- Supports running Java programs with package handling.
- Supports `java -cp bin Main` format for running compiled Java files.
- Supports package-based execution: `java -cp bin javaFiles.Main`.

### File Handling
- Ensures uniformity by checking for file existence before attempting compilation or execution.
- Uses modular language-specific files (`c.zig`, `cpp.zig`, `java.zig`, etc.) for handling compilation logic per language.

## How to Use
### Building a File
```sh
zig-out/bin/grynz build <file> [--out <output_dir>]
```
Example:
```sh
zig-out/bin/grynz build main.cpp --out ./bin
```

### Running a Java Program
```sh
zig-out/bin/grynz run Main --out ./bin/javaFiles
```
For package-based execution:
```sh
zig-out/bin/grynz run javaFiles.Main --out ./bin
```

## Future Plans
- **Project Structure Detection:**
  - Detect `Cargo.toml` for Rust projects.
  - Detect Go modules for Go projects.
  - Extend support for Java Maven/Gradle structures.
- **Compiler Auto-Installation:**
  - If a required compiler is missing, prompt the user to install it.
- **More Language Support:**
  - Plan to add support for C#, TypeScript, Gleam etc.
- **More Advanced Execution Handling:**
  - Support executing compiled C/C++/Rust binaries directly.
  - Support running scripts (Python, JavaScript) in future versions.
